1) Drop all remote sql table

DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(max)=''

SELECT @sql += ' Drop table ' + QUOTENAME(TABLE_SCHEMA) + '.'+ QUOTENAME(TABLE_NAME) + '; '
FROM   INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE  TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE'

Exec Sp_executesql @sql


2) Get local db generate script 

3) Run on remote db (From create first table, _MigrationHistory) (Remove all using statement)

4) Checkout the branch of Data Service you want to publish, right click Solution, then publish. 

   include <customErrors mode="Off"/> to check errors.

5) Checkout the branch of Cygni, include missing file in solution, change dataservice url,publish. 
I excluded the obj/Release folder (and everything under it) from the project, and then the build started working again.
delete obj folder
remove missing files (make sure they are not referenced in javascript application)
If still not working, create another app service
